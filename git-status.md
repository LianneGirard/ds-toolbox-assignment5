#Definition: git status

Git status is a git command that allows you to check on the status of the files in your repository. You can use it to see which branch you are on, which files have been modified and where they are (staging, committed, etc.) 
In the Jupyter IDE, if you click on the git icon on the lefthand side, then click on 'changes', this will show you the same information as git status. To note, you must be within the directory file to see details!
